**Name of Student:** Richard Barbour

**Name of Project:** CapstoneBlazorServerSite

**Project's Purpose or Goal:** An ASP.NET Blazor server-side-based website for an untitled word puzzle game that lets users play the game whether they are signed in or not. But authenticated users can view leader boards and track their own stats. Capstone project to focus on the website functionality and NOT the game itself.

**List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:**
* The ability for users to navigate to the site.
* The ability for users to register for an account.
* The ability for users to sign into their account.
* The ability for users to see leaderboards for the game based on a seeded database. (For the MVP only, users will not be able to see their own stats because no such stats will exist at the time of registration; the game must be playable first.)

**What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.**
- HTML/CSS
- C# & ASP.NET:
  - Visual Studio (IDE)
  - Blazor (web application framework)
  - ASP.NET Core Identity
  - Entity Framework Core
- MySQL

**If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.**  

- Splash page with CSS/JS animations and interactive SPA functionality for registration, login, etc.
- Integrating the word puzzle game with the capstone project so users can also play the game itself instead of just registering and signing in.
- Show actual player stats and leaderboards after users play the game (instead of just dummy leaderboard stats as part of the MVP).

**What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?**
- JavaScript
- dotnet-js-interop package from npmjs (provides abstractions and features for interop between .NET and JavaScript)
- MudBlazor (Blazor library for styling and interactivity)

**Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?**  
N/A.
